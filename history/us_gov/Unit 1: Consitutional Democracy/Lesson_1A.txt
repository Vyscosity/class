Essay Prompt:
In an argumentative essay, take a position on whether the principles articulated in the Declaration of Independence are still relevant in today's American society. Consider the ongoing debates about individual rights, the role of government, and the pursuit of happiness. Support your argument with historical context, examples from contemporary politics, and your own analysis of the Declaration's enduring significance.

=============================================================================

	After months of debate the Declaration of Independence, a document that articulated the desire of the thirteen British colonies in America to be independent states, was adopted by the Continental Congress on the 4th of July, 1776. This marked a shift in not just the governance of the colonies but in the expectation of all governments thereafter. These principles, based on the enlightened works of great writers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, radically changed the way that the governments interacted with the governed; but are these principles still relevant in today's American society? Definitly, the philosphical notions outlined in the Declaration of Independence are still very important because they are ethically universal ideals, the foundation upon which our legal system rests, and an important vantage to ground contemporary decisions. As Churchill torted, “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it;” this here too applies.
